Mainly demonstrate deep reinforcement learning for map-less robot navigation and urban traffic management. 

<!--more-->

Robotic map-less navigation used CNNs in deep learning and DQN variants in reinforcement learning. The effect of smooth speed, dynamic obstacle avoidance and reaching the target point was achieved. It should be noted that this project started in October 2019.

Reduce waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians through traffic signal control. According to compliance requirements, only part of the content can be displayed. 

* Delivered installation instructions for SUMO (2 pages), tf1 (3 pages) and tf2 (2 pages) without the conda environment, documentation (5 pages) to help with network setup and related package version requirements.
* Update TensorFlow 1.X version to PyTorch.
* The pure Python code for the different maps is between 200-250kb.
* Delivered a readme file describing the code usage, parameter configuration, model description and results in detail.

Red points represented obstacles, green point represented target points, and blue points represented the robot. Monte Carlo, SARSA, and Q learning algorithms were used for obstacle avoidance and transportation. The technology can be used for warehouse logistics or factory transportation. It should be noted that this project started in March 2020.
